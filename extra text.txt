These are some images made in gimp. There is a duck with a boat and Nixon with a California Rasin head. These photos were made using GIMP. To make the duck and boat image I took the background from an image and pasted it over the lake because I liked it better then adjusted the colors so the original was more red to try and match it with the red sky of the original. The duck and boat were pasted in and copied to make a reflection in the water. The raisin's colors were made black and white to match the rest of the photo and pasted over Nixon's head. Here there will be more information later.
