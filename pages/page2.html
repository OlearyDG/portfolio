<t>Welcome to the deep thoughts page</t>
    <br>
    <p>
        Here there will be thoughts about this class and the projects in it. This page will have reflections on many different topics relating to computer science and programming. This webpage is what I am thinking about right now and html in general because this is the first time I have used it. Currently I am also thinking about how I am going to put 200 words on this page.
