<div class="about">
            <t> I am a senior at RHS and have taken all the Computer Science classes that RHS offers. <br>I have two Shih-tzus and this is a picture of one of them. His name is Mango and he is about 10 years old. My other dog's name is Tico and he is about the same age. After high school I am planning on going to college somewhere in Minnesota, hopefully at the University of Minnesota. In college I plan on majoring in an engineering related field.</t>
