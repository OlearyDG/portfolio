<div class="child2">This is my dice lab. At first I just had trouble working with the animation and the timer, but after messing with it enough it finally worked. I then had some trouble converting it to Javascript classes. After doing that there were a few small issues like how Javascript had an issue with i being decalared multiple times. After that I added the count of how many of each die number is on screen, and I did that with and array and for loop by storing each side count in a spot in the array and printing it out in a loop.</div>
