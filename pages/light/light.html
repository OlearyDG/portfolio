            <t>This is my lightning lab. In this lab I had trouble converting it to javascript and putting it on the web. At first when I made it into javascript it would not switch when the lightning hit the ground because when I coded it in java the code that ran the timer relied on the fact that ints in java cut off decimals, but because everything is a var in javascript it would keep the decimals. When I put it on the website it had errors loading and running because it couldn't find the images, so after messing with it and the test page I made I discovered it looks for images from the folder the html page is in, so I moved the whole project into one folder and it worked.</t>
