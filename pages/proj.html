<p> Welcome to the projects page
<body bgcolor=green>
<br><img src="../images/finproj2019.png" class="image1"> <div class="pacbio"> This is my final project for AP Computer science. It is a version of Pac-Man done in processing. A difficulty I had with this project was the ghost's movement, and to get it I use Math.random to have the ghosts move and reset it every time they toucehd the wall. But this created an issue where the ghosts would reach the outer border and eternally circle it never reaching the middle. to solve this I had it so every random interval the ghost randomly changes direction so the movement is more varied and it will stay in the middle of the maze.</div>
