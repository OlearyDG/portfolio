It is a version of Pac-Man done in <br>processing. A difficulty I had with this project was the ghost's <br>movement, and toget it I use Math.random to have the ghosts move and <br>reset it every time they touched the wall. But this created an issue where the <br>ghosts would reach the outer border and eternally circle it never <br>reaching the middle. to solve this I had it so every random interval the ghost <br>randomly changes direction so the movement is more varied and it<br> will stay in the middle of the maze.</p></div>
